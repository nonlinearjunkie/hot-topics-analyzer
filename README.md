# hot-topics-analyzer

This project aims to list trending topics in a given city. For each of the topics, we will then gather the discussions happening around in various social media platforms. The discussions will be then grouped in three major categories:
1. Discussions that have positive sentiment for a given topic
2. Discussions that have neutral sentiment for a given topic
3. Discussions that have negative sentiment for a given topic

For each of the discussion groups(positive, negative and neutral), we will then form a multiple clusters of discussions sharing a common viewpoint and represent the cluster with a viewpoint that gives holistic idea about the cluster.

Finally, we will develop a dashboard to view the analysis done above.
